# bamazon

<!-- The app is to create an app similar to Amazon, called Bamazon. Create a MySQL database called bamazon that contains a table called 'products.' The app should take in orders from customers and deplete the stock accordingly from the store's inventory (minimum). -->

<!-- Details: 
Products table to have the columns: item_id (unique id for each product), product name, department name, price/cost, stock quantity. Should have 10 items to begin with, and have a node application where it displays the entire table to a customer. Prompt the user to ask them for the id of the product they would like to buy, then ask how many units the customer would like to purchase. 
Check the inventory to see if it has enough in stock for the purchase. If there is enough stock, update the remaining quantity and show total cost to the customer. -->
